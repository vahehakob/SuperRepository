\section{My Understanding and Decomposition of the Problem}

\paragraph{ Basic Idea: }
"Bayesian statitics indicate us to adapt our belief when acquiring when acquiring new data".
In order to do this, recall Baye's first law
$$
p(Clicked | Data) = \frac{p(Data | Clicked)p(Clicked)}{p(Data)},
$$
whereas $Data$ means in our context some parameter configuration. 
One of the main practical problem here is to select out a parameter subset for which the 
above formula could be adapted. \\
Here is how I decomposed and try solve the problem.


\subsection{Step$0$: file correction}
The file lines are irregular i.e. there are some empty fields and some programs are not going to be able to make the difference
between an empty elements/space and a normal space. I figured out that the fields country and campaign 
where incpomplete and just corrected the inputted file putting a None if one of these fields were missing.

\subsection{Step$1$: identify relevant variables and attribute a probability}
There, that is a tricky problem that would require some experience or more careful study.
I wanted to simplify the problem, although my approach can be easily extended to a broader parameter set.

I have chosen the fields ad, country, bannertype. My criteria were the followings:
 I pick up fields that I think I understand and that I think should be relevant. 
I have also looked at the parameters variability and that might have been a reasonable criterion(not too much variability but not too few).


\subsection{Step$2$: the method and its implementation}
The code selects out the element where a click was recorded. 
Then I list all the parameters combinations for which a click occured, according to the $3$ parameters I considered to be relevant. 

My idea is that the list elements can be used as the $Data$ in Baye's first law.
My understanding is as follow, in the equation above:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p(Clicked)$ is the probability for an add to get clicked on.
\item $p(Data)$ is the probability to find a given parameter configuration present in the list.
In python, one can easily identify the number of occurences of $Data$ in the sample and the probability follows.
\item $p(Data | Clicked)$ is the probability of finding the particular $Data$ or parameter configuration if the add is clicked on.
This quantity can also be built up quite easily summing up the clicks found over all the $Data$ configurations.
\end{itemize}

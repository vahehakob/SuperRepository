Simple test for the activation of the MongoDB database from the C# MongodDB.Driver.
The MongoDB database has to be started separatedly and runs by default on the data/db directory.
WINDOWS settings: 
C:mongodb
C:data/db
These directories are either creted during the install of mongodb or are to be created by hand. mongodb is launched with either
C:mongodb/bin/mongo.exe
C:mongodb/bin/mongod.exe, 
whereas the latest is used for running the present C# code.

!!!Prototype(sketch of)!!!

Toy Pricer, requires the installation of Eigen lib.
Does MC for basical products and does basic experiments with a generalised class for the fin. products using template classes as well as gives a struct. for nice parallelisation.

Ideas played with:
	-see everything as vector through time
	As a result, we can use the Eigen library and its optimistions.
	-every Fin. product is based on an underlying 
	  (at the lowest level, the BM has a random genearted number as an underlying)
	-filtration or infos should ported through time --> filtration class
	-MC simulated generating vector/matrices i.e Multi-trajectories
	(therefore, a random flow obj ios built up)  

Structure:
PO is the simple layer, contains simple objects
P1 contains more elaborated items
P2 contains the complexes ones

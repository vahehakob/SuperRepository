Every row in the file is an "ad impression". That means, an ad from one of Madvertise's advertiser clients has been shown to a user. All the fields are information relating to that event, such as device type, banner type, etc. The last two fields are information about the click and the conversion, respectively. You can ignore the last field for now, but the click field signifies if an ad has been shown and subsequently clicked by the user. The fields represent:

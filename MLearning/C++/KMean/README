Program compiled from diferent progrs picked up on the internet and 
+/- C++ redisigned. 
It generates a random sample and applying the LLoyd algo to determine "subsets".
It is an ~C++ adaptation of a C code I found on the internet.

--Number of points and of cluster are hard-coded.
--LLoyd Algorithm starts by an initial placement of K points sites in the input domain.

	Steps:
	1) The Voronoi diagram is computed:
		This corresponds to a disection of the space into regions, based on a distance.
	2) The centroids are computed.
	3) --> new Voronoi cells defined, back to 1)

Running:
g++ -o kmean kmean.cpp
./kmean.out 1000 3 > pic.eps
epstopdf pic.eps
echo "it's done...."
